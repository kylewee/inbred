            <h3>🎯 My Mission: Fixing the Trust Problem in Auto Repair</h3>
            <p><strong>The whole reason I became a mechanic is because you can't trust most mechanics.</strong> I've been on the other side - getting ripped off, overcharged, and lied to about unnecessary repairs. I started this business to be the mechanic I wished I could find when I needed one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trust-point">
            <h3>🔧 What Makes a Trustworthy Mechanic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keeps Skills Current:</strong> Modern vehicles use complex electronics and software. I stay updated on diagnostics and new technology through continuous training.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicates Openly:</strong> I explain problems in clear language, show you what's wrong when possible, and present all your options - not just the most profitable one.</li>
                <li><strong>Experience Across Vehicle Types:</strong> I've worked on everything from old pickup trucks to modern hybrids, giving me the knowledge to properly diagnose your specific issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional and Organized:</strong> My tools are clean, my workspace is organized, and I show up on time. Professionalism in small things reflects quality in big things.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="quote">
            "I aim to do the right thing 10 times out of 10. Not 9.8 times - every single time."
        </div>

        <div class="trust-point">
            <h3>💡 How I Prove My Ethics to Customers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Show You the Problem:</strong> I'll show you the worn brake pads, the leaking gasket, or the diagnostic codes on my scanner. No "trust me, it's broken."</li>
                <li><strong>Explain Your Options:</strong> Sometimes there's a $50 fix and a $500 fix. I'll tell you about both and let you decide what's right for your situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Old Parts:</strong> When I replace something, I keep the old part to show you why it needed replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>No Unnecessary Upsells:</strong> If your oil change doesn't need a $200 engine flush, I won't try to sell you one.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Pricing:</strong> My rates are competitive and transparent. No hidden "shop fees" or surprise charges.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Digital Receipts:</strong> Detailed invoices with parts costs and labor breakdown</li>
                <li><strong>Online Reviews:</strong> Check my Google and Facebook reviews - real customers sharing real experiences</li>
