Hi Hale,

I have a brand registered: Mobilemechanic.best (ff9797fe-a05e-4131-a6cf-6f5d2ca7bf33) - currently pending approval from Dec 4th.

I want to use this number for my mobile mechanic business (customer calls, appointment scheduling, SMS notifications).

Should I wait for brand approval before creating a campaign, or can I proceed now?

Thanks,
Kyle
