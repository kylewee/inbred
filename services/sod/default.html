    <span class="auto-style3">Benefits of Proper Soil Preparation</span><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Uniformity</li>
        <li>Increased Density</li>
        <li>Faster Recovery From Wear</li>
        <li>Reduced Use of Water, Fertilizer, Chemicals</li>
        <li>Reduced Maintenance</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    Tilling allows for optimum root growth. Sod needs sunlight, air, water and
    nutrients. Simply put, if it's lacking any one of these the sod will suffer. In the right proportions, the
    grass will flourish, but many soils are compact. By tilling the soil, air and nutrients are
    stirred up and readily available to the sod. This will allow for rapid new root growth.
    As long as you can provide the water and sunlight!

    <p>The availability and cost of different types of sod grasses is generally found in this order starting with the highest to lowest cost of sod:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Bermuda - 419 Tifton</li>
        <li>Shade Tolerant St. Augustine Grass (Bitter Blue)</li>

    <p>Depending on what type of sod you choose and where the lawn is located, landscapers in the
    southern United States will generally sod a lawn according to the following conditions:</p>

    <p>Optimum growth of turf depends on many management factors, one of which is ensuring a sufficient supply of plant nutrients.</p>

    <p>Topsoil is often scraped off and removed during construction, and as a result nutrient
    and organic matter levels are often lower in these disturbed sites than
    in native soils.</p>
