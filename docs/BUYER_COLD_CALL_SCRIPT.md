## The Script

### Opening (10 seconds)

**If owner answers:**
> "Hey [NAME], this is Kyle with EZ Lead. I'll be quick - do you guys take on new sod jobs in [CITY]?"

**If receptionist/employee:**
> "Hey, who handles your new job inquiries? I've got customers looking for sod work in [CITY]."

---

### Hook (15 seconds)

> "Perfect. So here's why I'm calling - I run a lead generation company and I've got homeowners in [CITY] requesting quotes for sod installation. Instead of letting these sit, I'd rather send them to a local company that can actually help them. You interested?"

**Wait for response.**

---

### Value Prop (20 seconds)

> "Here's how it works: Homeowner fills out a form on our website wanting sod installed. I send you their name, phone, address, and what they need. You call them, close the job, keep 100% of the profit. I charge $35 per lead."

---

### Free Trial Close (15 seconds)

> "Tell you what - I'll send you the next 3 leads completely free. No card, no commitment. If they turn into jobs, we talk. If not, no hard feelings. Fair enough?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "How much per lead?"
> "$35. But let's not worry about that yet - try 3 free ones first. If they're garbage, you'll never hear from me again."

### "I'm too busy / have enough work"
> "That's actually perfect - means you're good at closing. When things slow down, you'll want a pipeline ready. Let me send you 3 free ones to test when you have a gap."

### "I've tried lead services before, they sucked"
> "Yeah, most of them do. That's why I'm offering 3 free - no risk to find out if mine are different. What area are you in?"

### "How do I know these are real?"
> "You'll get name, phone, address, and exactly what they asked for. Call them yourself within 5 minutes of getting the lead. If even one is fake, I'll never call you again."

### "Send me an email"
> "I can, but honestly the leads will go to someone else by then. Takes 30 seconds to set you up for 3 free ones. What's your cell number for the lead texts?"

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally get it. But these leads are coming in today regardless - I just need to know where to send them. It's free to try. What's the worst that happens?"

### "What's the catch?"
> "No catch. I need contractors who actually answer the phone and close jobs. If you do that, you'll want more leads and pay for them. If not, I wasted 3 leads. That's my risk, not yours."

### "I only work in [SPECIFIC AREA]"
> "Perfect, what zip codes? I'll only send you leads from there."

## Voicemail Script (30 seconds max)

> "Hey [NAME], this is Kyle. I run a lead gen company and I've got homeowners in [CITY] looking for sod installation. I'd like to send you 3 free leads to test out - no strings attached. Give me a call back at [YOUR NUMBER]. Again, that's Kyle, [YOUR NUMBER]. Thanks."

---

## Text Follow-Up (if no answer)

> "Hey [NAME], Kyle here from EZ Lead. Got homeowners in [CITY] needing sod work. Want to send you 3 free test leads - interested? Just reply YES and I'll set you up."

2. **Be direct** - No corporate speak, talk like a person
3. **Lead with free** - Removes all risk objections
4. **Assumptive close** - "What's your cell?" not "Would you like to try?"
5. **Sound like a peer** - You're a business owner too, not a salesperson
6. **Create urgency** - Leads are coming today, someone's getting them
