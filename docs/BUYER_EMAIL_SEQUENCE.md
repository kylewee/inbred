## Email 1: Day 0 (Initial Contact)

**Subject:** Sod leads in [CITY] - free to test

**Body:**
```
Hey [NAME],

I run a lead generation company and I've got homeowners in [CITY] looking for sod installation.

Instead of letting these leads sit, I'd rather send them to a local company that can actually help.

Here's the deal: I'll send you the next 3 leads completely free. No credit card, no commitment. You call them, close the job, keep 100% of the profit.

If they turn into work, we talk about more. If not, no hard feelings.

Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll set you up.

Kyle
EZ Lead
[PHONE]

## Email 2: Day 2 (Quick Follow-Up)

**Subject:** Re: Sod leads in [CITY] - free to test

**Body:**
```
Hey [NAME],

Quick follow up - did you see my last email?

Got homeowners requesting sod quotes in [CITY]. Happy to send you 3 free test leads if you want them.

Just reply "yes" and I'll add you.

Kyle
```

## Email 3: Day 5 (Social Proof)

**Subject:** Your competitor is getting these leads

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I sent 3 test leads to another sod company in [CITY] last week. They closed 2 of them.

Still have your spot open if you want it. Same deal - 3 free leads, no strings.

Takes 30 seconds to set up. Just need your cell number for the lead texts.

Reply if interested.

## Email 4: Day 9 (Value Stack)

**Subject:** What a $35 lead looks like

**Body:**
```
Hey [NAME],

Here's what you'd get:

- Customer name & phone
- Full address
- Exactly what they need (new lawn, repair, etc.)
- Sent to your phone within 60 seconds of request

Average sod job in [CITY]: $2,500+
Cost per lead: $35
Close rate for contractors who call within 5 min: 40%+

Math works out pretty well.

But don't take my word for it - try 3 free ones first.

Reply "yes" and I'll set you up today.

Kyle
```

## Email 5: Day 14 (Breakup)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I've reached out a few times about sending you free sod leads in [CITY].

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.

No worries - I'll send these to other contractors in the area.

If things change and you want leads later, just reply to this email. I'll still honor the 3 free test leads.

Good luck with the business.

## Personalization Variables

## Best Practices

1. **Send from real email** - kyle@ezlead4u.com, not noreply@
2. **Plain text only** - No images, no fancy formatting
3. **Short paragraphs** - 1-2 sentences max
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Most contractors check email on phone
5. **Reply-able** - Make sure replies come to you
6. **Personalize city** - Generic "your area" kills response rates

---

## After They Reply "Yes"

Send this immediately:

**Subject:** You're set up - here's what happens next

**Body:**
```
Awesome, you're in.

Quick setup:
- Best cell for lead texts: [REPLY WITH NUMBER]
- What cities/zips do you cover?

Once I have that, you'll get a text the moment a lead comes in. Save my number so you know it's a hot lead.

Talk soon,
Kyle
```
