# Buyer Acquisition - How to Reel Them In

**The Bait, The Hook, The Catch**

---

## The Problem

Cold calling sucks. And it makes you sound like every other annoying lead gen company that calls 30 times a day.

---

## The Bait (Worms)

### First 3 Leads Free
- No risk for contractor
- They close ONE, they made $300-1000+
- Now $25/lead feels like stealing
- You gave away $75 to land a customer worth $500/month for years

### Don't Pitch - Just Deliver
Instead of: "Want to buy leads? Sign up for our platform!"

Say: "I got a customer with a 2006 Honda needs brakes. In your area. Want the job?"

No selling. Just results first.

---

## The Hook

### Let Them Come To You

**Facebook Groups:**
- Local contractor groups ("Mechanics of North Florida")
- Post value first, offer leads later
- Don't spam - build reputation

**Craigslist:**
- "Mechanic leads available - St. Augustine"
- Contractors search for leads. Be where they look.

**Supply Shops:**
- Auto parts stores know every mechanic in town
- "Hey, any of your guys need more work?"

**Referrals:**
- One happy contractor knows 10 more
- "Know anyone else who wants leads?"

---

## The Catch

### The Lead Recruits For You
1. Get a lead, no buyer yet
2. Call the lead: "I'm finding you a mechanic"
3. Call local shops: "I have a customer ready NOW. Want it?"
4. They close it, they're hooked
5. "I get a few of these a week. Want me to keep sending them?"

No cold calling. Just warm handoffs.

---

## What NOT To Do

- Don't sound like the 30-calls-a-day guys
- Don't say "first 3 free!" like a pitch (just DO it)
- Don't over-promise
- Don't be greedy - EVER

---

## The Long Game

**Quality over quantity:**
- Good leads = happy contractors = they stay
- One contractor who trusts you for years > 10 randoms who churn

**Be local:**
- Know the contractors personally
- Relationship > transaction

**Be fair:**
- Don't sell same lead to 10 guys
- Don't squeeze on price
- Answer the phone when there's a problem

---

## Pricing Tiers

**First 3 leads = FREE** (test it out)

Then pick your tier:

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Basic** | $25/lead | Shared with other contractors |
| **Priority** | $35/lead | First in line, still shared |
| **Exclusive** | $90/lead | ONLY you, no competition, pre-screened |

All leads shared unless paying $90 for exclusive.
Exclusive leads are **vetted** - no tire kickers, no price shoppers, no BS.

- Turn on/off anytime
- No contracts
- **Minimum balance: $35-100** (keeps leads flowing)
- Balance low? Auto-pause until you reload
- No chasing payments, no invoices, no BS

---

## Market Selection (The Cheat Code)

**Only enter markets where you rank organically in a week.**

If you're on page 1 after a week:
- Competition is low
- Big players aren't paying attention
- PPC will be cheap (no bidding war)
- Organic + Paid = dominate the whole page

**Don't fight for:**
- "plumber los angeles" at $50/click
- Markets where Yelp/Angi are entrenched

**DO target:**
- "mobile mechanic st augustine" - wide open
- Small towns, specific niches
- Gaps the corporations don't care about

You're not trying to beat Yelp nationally.
You're owning the spots they ignore.

---

## The Math

**PPC Economics:**
- Cost per click: ~$3
- Sell lead for: $35
- If 1 in 10 clicks converts: $30 cost → $5 profit
- If 1 in 5 clicks converts: $15 cost → $20 profit

**3 leads/day = the magic number**
- 90 leads/month
- $3,150/month at $35/lead
- Enough to keep 5-10 contractors fed

**Once organic kicks in:** Those leads are FREE. 100% profit.
