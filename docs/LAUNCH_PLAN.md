**Goal:** 3 leads/day × $35/lead = $105/day = $3,150/month

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)

## Phase 2: First Buyer (Days 4-7)

### Find Hungry Contractors
- [ ] Run `scripts/find_hungry_contractors.py`
- [ ] Get 10 contractors from Google page 2-3
- [ ] These are the ones who NEED leads

### The Warm Handoff
- [ ] Wait for a real lead to come in
- [ ] Call contractor: "Got a customer needs [X]. Want it?"
- [ ] Give them the lead FREE
- [ ] They close it → they're hooked

### Sign Them Up
- [ ] "I get a few of these a week. Want more?"
- [ ] Create buyer account (3 free leads)
- [ ] Get initial deposit ($35-100)
- [ ] Turn on lead flow

## Phase 3: Turn On The Faucet (Week 2)

### Google Ads

- [ ] Target keywords:
  - "[service] near me"
  - "[service] [city]"
  - "mobile [service]"
  - "[service] same day"

### Track The Math
```
Cost per click: ~$3
Clicks per day: 5-7 (at $20 budget)
Conversion rate: 20% (1 in 5)
Leads per day: 1-2

Cost per lead: $15
Sell for: $35
Profit per lead: $20
```

### Optimize
- [ ] Which keywords convert best?
- [ ] Which landing page version wins?
- [ ] Kill what doesn't work
- [ ] Double down on what does

---

## Phase 4: Scale (Week 3+)

### Add More Buyers

- [ ] Keep 3-5 buyers per market (competition keeps them paying)
- [ ] Premium tier ($90) for exclusive leads

### Add More Markets
- [ ] Find next low-competition market
- [ ] Clone site, change location
- [ ] Repeat Phase 1-3

### Let Organic Kick In
